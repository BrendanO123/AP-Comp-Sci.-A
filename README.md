# Overview
This is a repository I created to keep track of all of my projects from my AP Computer Science A class. I took the class years ago and did not use git at the time, so there is not much of a version history. Additionally, all of the code is somewhat old and some of the projects may be dysfunctional, so use it with that in mind.
